# dentalemr-ws-service
A websocket (SignalR) Windows service


# DemrService
A Windows Service / Console Windows/win32 app that hosts a Kestrel websocket (SignalR) server that

1. Invokes Windows programs.
2. Returns file bytes from Windows or Zips up directory and returns zip bytes from Windows.

## DEMR Service (SignalR)

### Endpoints: 

    1. `http://127.0.0.1:5000/demr` 
    2. `https://127.0.0.1:5001/demr`, with the latter configured with a self-signed cert. This endpoint is required by Firefox when the Origin is https, but not in Chrome.

### CORS configuration

Allows origins: 
(https://github.com/DentalEMR/dentalemr-ws-service/blob/master/DemrService/Startup.cs#L36): 
- "https://localhost:44326" - for TestWebApp (below)
- "https://app.dentaledr.com", 
- "https://app.dentalemr.com"

### Methods:

- `BinaryExecuter(binaryPath, binaryArgs, transactionId)` that synchronously (one call to method until completion at a time in sequence) executes the binary at `binarPath` with `binaryArgs` and calls one of the two following client methods once the binary has completed execution:
- `BinaryExecuterAsync(binaryPath, binaryArgs, transactionId)` that asynchronously (more than one call to method runs in parallel) executes the binary at `binarPath` with `binaryArgs` and calls one of the two following client methods once the binary has completed execution:
    1. InvokeBinarySucceeded (exitCode, binaryStdOut, binaryStdErr, transactionId)


- `RetrieveFileAndPostAsync(path, isDir, url, transactionId)` that asynchronously zips the directory at `path` and uploads to `url` if `isDir` is true, else uploads the file at `path` to `url` and sends either:
    1. RetrieveFileAndPostFailed(tatusCode, reasonPhrase, transactionId) or
    2. RetrieveFileAndPostSucceeded(content, transactionId)

## File retriever

    1. InvokeBinaryExceptioned(ex.Message, transactionId)
- `HTTP GET: /api/RetrieveFile?path=<PATH>&isdir=false` where `path` is path of file to return if `isdir` is `false` or directory to zip and return if `isdir` is `true`.


# Installation

    1. From within Visual Studio, publish 'DemrService' project AND 'demrservice.pfx' to 'publish' folder.
    2. Zip / unzip 'publish' folder onto integration Windows computer.
    3. Double click 'demrservice.pfx' on integration computer and install certificate (required by Chrome but not Firefox for some reason)
    4. In Firefox navigate a browser tab to https://127.0.0.1:5001 and in warning select advanced and add exception (required by Firefox but not Chrome for some reason).
    5. Double click 'demrservice.exe' to run in console window. Ctrl-c exists program. Can be installed as a Windows service but this hasn't been fiddled with yet.

# Test applications

## TestConsoleApp 
A simple console app that accepts arguments and outputs a string including arguments to stdout.

## TestWebApp
An example SignalR websocket client implementation that reliably reconnects. SEE https://github.com/DentalEMR/dentalemr-ws-service/blob/master/TestWebApp/wwwroot/js/app.js .

# Implementation Notes

- demrservice.pfx was generated by exporting the development self-signed certificate.
